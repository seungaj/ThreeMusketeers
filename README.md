# threeMusketeers

 Three Musketeers Game is a 5x5 strategic board game. We created an original Three Musketeers Game and implemented creative functions. The newer version of the game archives each player's game history and login to maintain ranks. Our game has different design where login, alerts, notifications, saving moves, winning chance indicators are implemented. We used single responsibility principle and implemented a MVC pattern and created GUI for the game using JavaFX.
